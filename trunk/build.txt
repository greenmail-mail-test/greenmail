Building GreenMail
==================

1) Install the maven build tool (see http://maven.apache.org)
   and make sure you got Java >= 1.5 .

2) Run mvn from the project root directory:
   > mvn clean install

   In case of test failures, add the option "-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore" or
   disable the tests with "-Dtest".


Releasing GreenMail
===================

1) Build using release profile:
   > mvn clean install -Prelease 

   The release profile activates additional building of source jars etc.


Building the Maven site
=======================

Includes reports etc. This is not the real site!
> mvn site -Psite
